## Bio

Hi, I'm Brian Calhoon. I am a data scientist with 15 years of experience implementing, monitoring, evaluating, and assessing international development projects. I have worked with the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Defense, and private foundations. My experience includes working on projects in Haiti, Niger, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Ukraine, and shorter research assignments on many countries in Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia. I also enjoy making sourdough bread and pizza, skiing, and mixed martial arts. 

I am an avid R user with an interest in data visualization, GIS, Bayesian statistics, and natural language processing. If you are interested in learning R check out the [Humans Learning](https://dabrianc.github.io/website/blog.html) section of this website where I share code with explanations.

## Work with me

I'm available for consulting on short- or long-term assignments. You can [contact me](mailto:briancalhoon.consulting@gmail.com) to set up a time to discuss your project.
