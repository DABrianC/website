Hi, I'm Brian Calhoon. Welcome to my website. I enjoy playing with data in R and Python. I have an interest in data visualization, GIS, analyzing big data, Bayesian statistics, and natural language processing. I generally enjoy learning about the nitty gritty of how inputs from real life work their way through a data pipeline and end up in front of key stakeholders whether that's in a report, blog, website, or presentation. 

If you are new to code-based data analysis and looking from some short examples to play with I encourage you to check out the [Humans Learning](https://dabrianc.github.io/website/blog.html) section of this website where I share code with explanations targeting a general audience.

## Bio

I'm a data scientist with 15 years of experience implementing, monitoring, evaluating, and assessing international development projects. I have worked with the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Defense, and private foundations. My experience includes working on projects in Haiti, Niger, Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Ukraine. My work has focused on anti-corruption, capacity building, conflict, and generally helping others be more efficient. When I'm not working, I also enjoy making sourdough bread and pizza, skiing, and mixed martial arts. 

## Work with me

If you have a need for a data analyst/scientist, I'm available for short- or long-term consulting assignments. You can [contact me](mailto:briancalhoon.consulting@gmail.com) to set up a time to discuss your project or talk about sourdough.
