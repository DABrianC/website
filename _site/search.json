These were initially in-person or remote live sessions that I then put on a Github page. They are made up primarily of short – 5 minute-ish – lessons that focus on a single skill that I found useful to learn in my R journey. EnCompass closed in early 2025, but I didn’t want Humans Learning to end as there is still much to learn so I created this public site where it will live on. Now it is for anyone who is curious about data analytics and coding. There is no reason that it should only exist in R so I will add similar content in Python (or Julia) in the future. In addition, there will be more in depth dives into topics of interest to me. These will include Bayesian statistics, machine learning, LLMs, Quarto, and many other topics.

When I started learning R, I dove into Datacamp and played with the Gapminder dataset a lot. Then, one day I was asked to look at a dataset that I’d get by email. No problem, I thought. Then, the email arrived, and I looked at the .xlsx file on my screen. Hmmmm….How do I put this in my RStudio environment? I couldn’t print it and feed it to it…I couldn’t scan it….I could drop the file in….I was lost. I didn’t understand how to import a file. I walked down the hall and asked a friend. I don’t want you to experience this so consider this post your friend down the hall. Enjoy!"

Here are a few more observations.\n\nThe column with the question just holds the question variable and is blank.\nThe majority of rows in these columns are also blank.\nA single variable - favorite color - is spread out over a bunch of columns.\n\nTo simplify this, let’s put these all in a single column."

Then, let’s eliminate the 2nd column that is all blanks. Next, pivot the columns with the 1s in a single column, and change the 1s to the name of each color. Finally, we should put pivotted data in a column with a name that is clear and useful for coding – fav_color. Here’s the code to do this.\n\ndf1 &lt;- df |&gt; \n  select(-2) |&gt;  #eliminates the 2nd column\n  pivot_longer(cols = 2:5, #use these columns for the transformation\n               names_to = \"fav_color\", #Name the column where the the color names are stored\n               values_drop_na = TRUE) |&gt;  #remove the rows with missing data\n  select(-3) # remove the 1s since they no longer matter\n\nknitr::kable(df1) \n\n\n\n\nResp\nfav_color\n\n\n\n\nA\nblue\n\n\nB\nred\n\n\nC\ngreen\n\n\nD\npurple\n\n\nE\ngreen\n\n\nF\nblue\n\n\nF\nred\n\n\nF\npurple\n\n\nG\nblue\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccess! Within the pivot_longer() call, we told it to use columns 2 through 5 since we want to keep the Resp(ondents) column unchanged. We maintained the first column and added additional rows to account for the multiple colors selected by Resp F.\nNow we have two clean columns that display our data."
