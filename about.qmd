Humans Learning was originally founded as an internal tool for staff at EnCompass to learn the basics of data analysis with the R programming language. As such, it is made up primarily of short, 5 minute, lessons that focus on a single skill that I found useful as I learned R. I've decided to resurrect it and make it public to benefit anyone who is curious about data analytics and coding. There is no reason that it should only exist in R so I will add similar content in Python. In addition to this, there will more in depth dives into topics of interest to me. These will include Bayesian statistics, machine learning, LLMs, leveraging Quarto, and many others.
